# Updated-Portfolio

This homework assignment was to update our original portfolio and use the skills that we have gained since the first one was completed.

By looking at my original portfolio and my recently updated one, there are a lot of differences to be noted. 

The design itself has been updated but so has the code. It is easier to read and more organized than the first portfolio. 

Below are photos of the updated portfolio to give you a preview as to how the wenpage will look.
